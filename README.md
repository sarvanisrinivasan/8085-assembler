8085 Assembly Language Simulator in C (Code::Blocks)
This repository implements an 8085 microprocessor assembly language simulator written in C and designed for the Code::Blocks IDE.

Features:

Assembly Instruction Parsing: Parses human-readable assembly instructions into their core components (opcode, operands, addressing modes).
Machine Code Generation: Translates parsed assembly instructions into their corresponding hexadecimal opcodes, the machine language understood by the 8085 microprocessor.
Learning Objectives:

Enhance your C programming skills.
Gain a deeper understanding of assembly language and its interaction with hardware architecture.
Explore the inner workings of the 8085 microprocessor.
Getting Started:

Prerequisites: Basic understanding of C programming (resources online).
8085 Knowledge: Familiarity with the 8085 instruction set (resources online).
Code::Blocks IDE: Learn the basics through tutorials (resources online).
